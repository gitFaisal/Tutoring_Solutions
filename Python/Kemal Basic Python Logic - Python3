His first customer will receive free donuts for a year
His first 12 customers will receive a dozen free donuts today (the first customer gets both free donuts for a year and an immediate dozen, so they should be notified of both)
His first 200 customers can purchase their first dozen donuts for $1, but because customers #1-12 already received the first dozen for free, they should not be notified of this deal (it’s really for customers #13-200)
Customer #144 wins free donuts for a month (144 is Joe’s favorite number) and should not be notified of the dozen donuts for $1 either
Customers #201-500 can purchase their donuts for half price
Everyone else can take advantage of Joe’s last opening day offer: buy two donuts, get the third free - only show this notification to people who haven’t received any other offers
Every single customer should be notified of a year-round deal they can share with their friends: buy a dozen donuts, get the 13th free!
